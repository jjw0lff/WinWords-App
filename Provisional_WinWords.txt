ABSTRACT

A system and method for real-time, privacy-preserving communication enhancement that improves empathy and clarity while maintaining factual accuracy. 
The invention comprises an intent preservation engine that locks factually significant entities; an empathy delta scoring system that quantifies 
improvements across clarity, tone, cultural sensitivity, accessibility, and compliance; an adaptive context horizon that dynamically resizes processing 
windows based on emotional volatility; a resource governor that guarantees sub-200ms response times through graceful degradation; and a human-in-the-loop 
enforcement mechanism requiring explicit user approval before transmission. The system operates fully on-device, integrates through standard OS APIs, and 
includes enterprise analytics and regulatory compliance verification. Unlike prior art that provides only grammar correction or templated responses, this 
invention delivers fact-preserving, empathy-scored, compliance-ready communication enhancement, enabling ethical, accessible, and reliable interaction 
across consumer and enterprise environments.

------------------------------------------------------------
FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to artificial intelligence systems for digital communication enhancement. More specifically, it concerns methods and systems 
for real-time, on-device text processing that preserve factual accuracy, improve empathy, enforce ethical safeguards, ensure accessibility, and provide 
regulatory compliance verification under strict latency and privacy constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Digital communication dominates modern interaction, yet existing tools are insufficient:

- Technical deficiencies: cloud dependence, latency (>200ms), lack of personalization, no factual integrity protection.
- Ethical deficiencies: risk of manipulation, bias perpetuation, lack of transparency, harmful or discriminatory outputs.
- Social consequences: miscommunication, relationship trauma, workplace conflicts, cultural misunderstandings, barriers for neurodivergent individuals, 
  and regulatory compliance failures.

Prior art (Grammarly, Google Smart Reply, Microsoft Editor) addresses grammar, spelling, or templated replies but fails to deliver real-time, 
fact-preserving, empathy-aware, and compliance-ready enhancements.

------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This invention is an "autocorrect for empathy and compliance." It introduces an Emotionally Intelligent Communication Enhancement System that integrates 
five core modules:

1. Intent Preservation Engine™ — detects and locks factual entities (dates, names, amounts, contractual terms).
2. Empathy Delta Scoring™ — quantifies communication improvement across clarity, empathy, culture, accessibility, and compliance.
3. Adaptive Context Horizon™ — dynamically adjusts context size based on emotional volatility analysis.
4. Resource Governor™ — ensures <200ms latency with graceful degradation from full neural to template fallback.
5. Human-in-the-Loop Enforcement™ — cryptographically enforces user approval before transmission.

Applications include healthcare, finance, education, enterprise productivity, and accessibility contexts where empathy and factual integrity are critical.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[System Overview]
The system integrates five modules operating on-device with strict latency and privacy guarantees. Text inputs are captured, analyzed, enhanced, 
and presented as multiple variants for user approval. A continuous feedback loop ensures personalization without compromising factual accuracy or ethics.

[Intent Preservation Engine]
Detects protected entities (dates, times, names, amounts, contractual terms) using regex and semantic analysis. Variants are validated to prevent 
modification of such entities. Cryptographic verification ensures compliance.

[Empathy Delta Scoring]
Computes weighted scores across five dimensions: clarity (25%), emotional appropriateness (30%), cultural sensitivity (20%), accessibility (15%), 
and compliance (10%). Generates improvement explanations for user transparency.

[Adaptive Context Horizon]
Analyzes emotional volatility across conversation history. Dynamically scales processing context between 0.3x–2.0x base size for efficiency and nuance.

[Resource Governor]
Monitors battery, thermal, memory, CPU, and queue depth. Applies progressive degradation: full neural → reduced → template → original fallback, 
while preserving factual integrity and meeting sub-200ms targets.

[Human-in-the-Loop Enforcement]
Variants are displayed in overlays, sidebars, or inline presentations with explanations. User approval is cryptographically required before sending, 
ensuring transparency and preventing unauthorized auto-send.

[Enterprise Integration]
Analytics dashboard provides team empathy scores, compliance status, and communication health metrics. Compliance filters enforce HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, 
and ADA requirements. Audit trails are cryptographically signed for verification.

[Ethical Safeguards & Privacy]
Manipulation detection filters block exploitative content. All data is stored encrypted (AES-256), contextual feedback is hashed for privacy, and 
federated learning with differential privacy enables collective improvements without exposing raw user data.

CLAIMS

Independent Claims:

1. A system for emotionally intelligent communication enhancement comprising:
   (a) an intent preservation engine configured to detect and lock factually significant entities;
   (b) an empathy enhancement processor generating variants under <200ms latency;
   (c) an empathy delta scoring system calculating multi-dimensional improvement metrics;
   (d) an adaptive context horizon dynamically adjusting based on emotional volatility;
   (e) a resource governor ensuring graceful degradation across device states;
   (f) a human-in-the-loop enforcement module requiring explicit user approval; and
   (g) wherein all processing occurs on-device without transmitting data externally.

2. The system of Claim 1 wherein the intent preservation engine applies regex and semantic analysis to detect entities including dates, times, names, 
   monetary amounts, and contractual terms, and rejects any variant altering such entities.

3. The system of Claim 1 wherein the empathy delta scoring system assigns weighted scores across clarity, emotional appropriateness, cultural sensitivity, 
   accessibility accommodation, and compliance verification, and generates explanatory outputs.

4. The system of Claim 1 wherein the adaptive context horizon analyzes emotional volatility across conversation history and scales context length between 
   0.3x and 2.0x of a base window.

5. The system of Claim 1 wherein the resource governor monitors device resources including battery, thermal, memory, and CPU load, and progressively 
   degrades processing from full neural to reduced complexity to template-based fallback.

6. The system of Claim 1 further comprising enterprise analytics and compliance verification modules configured to detect violations of HIPAA, SOX, 
   PCI-DSS, and ADA requirements, and generate audit-ready reports.

7. The system of Claim 2 wherein factual entities are cryptographically validated for preservation across all variants.
8. The system of Claim 3 wherein clarity comprises 25% weight, emotional appropriateness 30%, cultural sensitivity 20%, accessibility 15%, and compliance 10%.

10. The system of Claim 5 wherein memory use is limited to 45MB and storage to 50MB.
11. The system of Claim 6 wherein compliance filters apply pattern recognition to detect protected health information, financial terms, and payment data.
